### Problem

- Minimum time that all k painter will take to complete all the work
- Work at arr[i] should be done by only one painter, meaning they can't share the work.
- arr[i] represents the time it will take to complete that work.

### Intuition

- We can see that we have to find minimum time so it's like min-max problems.
- Minimize time! So we have to find the range of time in which our answer will lie.
- So when we see minmax problems we think of Binary search.

### Approach

- Find min and max values in which answer can lie.
- min value = max(arr) WHY? because arr[i] = time it take to complete that work
- Now if we take min value as any value less then max(arr) then that value which contains max(arr) will not be done as time is less.
- example: [5,6,3,8,4] => max(arr) is 8 . Now if we take min value= 6, then [p1,p2,p3,_,p5]
- here p1 to p5 represents the painter number. Now p4 cant be able to do as it has 6 units of time and need to complete 8 in that.

- There for minvalue = max(arr) i.e in this 8. So if we take 8 then 5 painters will able to complete task in 8 units of time.
- So if we have 8 units of time then we will need 5 painters(size of an array).
- We can do all the work using 1 painter but that would take sum(arr) times = 26 units of time.
- SO we have to minimize the time also utilizing K painters.
- range [ max(arr), sum(arr) ]. We have to BS in this range.

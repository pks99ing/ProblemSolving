## Minimize the maximum distance between any two gas stations

### arr[1,2,3,4,5] K=4

- so we have to place 4 gas stations such that the distance between any two gas stations is minimal
- let's say we choose distance = 0.25 then [1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2 3 4 4.5 5]. We have place all K=4 stations in middle but still the maximum distance is 1 i.e in between 2 & 3.
- If we place distance = 0.5 then [1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5] . We have place all K=4 stations in middle and maximum distance between any two is 0.5.
- We can try many but this is the answer.
- Now Why this is the answer?

## Intutions:

- Its a min-max problem then we can think of binary search as possible solution
- What can be the range of our answers i.e search space low = 0 (Which means if we have arr = [1] and k = 1, then we can place at same position and min distance = 0)
- high = maximum distance between any two gas stations. Why? Because if arr = [1,5,12] no matter how many stations we place in between 1 and 5 then max distance will be still 7 i.e in between 12 and 5. So the max distance depends on distance between two stations.

## Approach:

- Now here typicall binary search won't work because `while(low<=high)` this type will run infinitely while the values are floating point decimal numbers. So we have to change it to `while(high-low>1e-6)` here `1e-6 = 10^-6`.
- Also low and high will not increament or decrement by 1 or any integer number rather we will set it to mid.
- Now for every mid we encounter we can how many stations can we placed keeping the min distance of mid.
- If `count > K` : This means we can place more then K Station, but we need to place K , so we need to increase the distance, so that we can place less stations in between => `low = mid`
- else `high = mid`

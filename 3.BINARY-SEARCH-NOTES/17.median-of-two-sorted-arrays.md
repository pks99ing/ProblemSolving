## Median Of an two Sorted Arrays

- Lets assume we have only even length array

Given `arr1 = [1,2,4,8]` and `arr2 = [5,9,11,12]`
Now to find median we actually should sorted the array into new arr3 = [1,2,4,`5,8`,9,11,12]. Median would be `(5+8)/2`;

- By this we can observer that `n1=4` and `n2=4` then leftHalf would be `floor((n1+n2)/2)`
- What is left half? Basically it the middle Section of resultant array, which divide the two arrays
- We will use binary search in range `[low = 0 , high = n1]`. Why n1 not n1-1?
- [1,2,4,8] when `mid1 = n1`, Then `l1 = mid1-1` and `r2 = mid1`, where `mid1=floor((low+high)/2)`.
- `mid2` will be calculated based on `mid1` and how many elements should be there in leftHalf section.
- `mid2 = leftHalf - mid1`
- To handle edge cases like `arr1 = [1,2,3,4]` and `arr2 = []`, we swap them and always ensure the smaller array is treated as the first array.This approach optimizes our binary search, especially when array1 is smaller than array2, improving the efficiency of our solutions.
- Always remember to run binary search on smaller arrays
